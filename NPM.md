# Sementic versioning

Semantic versioning is a formal convention for determining the version number of new software releases. The standard helps software users to understand the severity of changes in each new distribution. A project that uses semantic versioning will advertise a Major, Minor and Patch number for each release.

Eg - 
console.log('Hello')

console.log(Module);

console.log(document);
