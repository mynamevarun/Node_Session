### Install Process

1. first check the version is existing or not if not then install

node --version.

2. if not exist then install.

There are two ways of installing node.

1. download the installer or use some kind of package manager or version manager,

2. So I have used nvm as it is my development machine. nvm is node version manager if we install node using nvm its easy to maintain different version of node to work with different projects.

 

open vs code in a folder.

create app.js file.

and simply run the console statement.

node app.js

lets print window and it gives us error.
